# Higgs Boson Classification

The repository contains the implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques applied to the binary classification problem of distinguishing signal (particle collisions that result in a Higgs boson) processes and background (collisions that result in other particles) processes.

The best model so far has been Boosted Decision Trees with an AUC value of 0.89.
